# Simulation in CASA 6

Get creative with radio interferometry simulations. 
Construct interesting data sets to be used for test scripts, bug reports and scientific characterization of numerical features in CA
SA.

The attached .ipynb tutorial covers the following : 

    - Install CASA 6 and Import required libraries
    
    - Make an empty MS with the desired sub-structure
    - Make a true sky model
    - Predict visibilities onto the DATA column of the MS
    - Add noise and other errors
    
    - A few example use cases
        - Image one channel
        - Cube imaging with a spectral line
        - Continuum wideband imaging with model subtraction
        - Self-calibration and imaging
    
     - Ideas for CASA developers and test writers to do beyond these examples.
